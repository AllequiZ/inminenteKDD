ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),1,"﻿ Bueno, hola, este oficialmente se volvió mi spot favorito en la Universidad Federal de Santa María. El episodio de esta semana quería que fuera un poquito más relajado y hace un buen tiempo no hago monólogos, yo creo que la mayor parte del tiempo voy a mirar el panorama, pero bueno, si están solo en Spotify, donde estoy grabando el podcast es una pista de atletismo, pero tiene, o sea... Tiene como muchas vibras a la universidad gringa, no sé por qué. Pero bueno, básicamente, estos días he estado haciendo muchas cuentas y pensando mucho en lo que es este intercambio. Y básicamente, caí en cuenta de que ya me falta solo un mes antes de volver a mi casa en Colombia. Y el día que me vaya va a cumplir. Nueve meses y unos cuantos días, pero en síntesis son nueve meses en los que viví en Brasil,",0.047463216,-0.01586258,0.005134024,-0.112715475,-0.008510861,0.025193665,0.043999918,0.026593601,0.036290906,0.035596997,0.00786608,-0.028802231,-0.058362033,-0.013707576,0.030246165,0.0339219,-0.0290512,0.059077185,0.020473417,0.03735732,0.106748044,-0.026176076,-0.06205741,0.071923524,-0.0433555,0.02121238,0.0063177813,-0.00853688,-0.033253886,-0.07204448,-0.05818662,0.036405914,0.15194917,-0.0017413109,0.011914274,0.0072774463,0.059971,-0.059633918,-0.1347187,0.09465724,-0.04714792,0.067414746,0.033903595,0.0067042094,-0.04269926,-0.09161891,0.07422036,0.035213638,0.09156484,-0.045610674,-0.03986571,0.001808638,-0.029041763,0.0013188977,-0.098941386,0.052756563,0.013952416,0.00409636,0.06630716,0.02832337,-0.029300224,0.031336125,0.010541792,0.0341558,0.079216994,-0.024269223,0.041955873,0.08079436,-0.067880735,0.04984434,0.08621696,0.01457716,-0.029681306,0.023575643,-0.023672417,0.09854248,-0.013817648,0.05107541,-0.011527612,-0.08465569,0.017689234,-0.006359369,-0.009442913,-0.07487675,-0.0022409847,0.0068398705,0.01026582,-0.02884513,-0.0071967063,-0.032233596,0.011648186,0.033815462,-0.03979415,-0.0055665746,0.067795865,0.055223703,0.0045846635,-0.051915336,0.07786661,-0.0018088841,0.087790735,0.08587511,0.07140926,0.009598413,-0.014110689,0.033980988,-0.01694457,0.03409948,0.09231812,0.028676443,-0.014888357,-0.013063652,0.0123419,-0.0124651985,-0.024014339,-0.020431269,0.029191628,-0.03596283,-0.0056947917,0.009953482,0.0009934029,-0.027861733,-0.064557046,-0.0417218,0.0026498383,-0.103864454,0.030497523,1.500528e-32,0.04321515,0.045973036,0.0373499,-0.013166255,0.0189037,0.033785705,-0.047519013,0.041768104,-0.10095418,0.037605293,-0.09693459,0.05339999,-0.014821912,0.06507224,0.057760347,0.0565763,0.010526656,-0.03032188,0.024647694,0.045682807,-0.0004530556,0.03495022,-0.018199174,-0.018365027,-0.01637399,0.09821299,0.02988003,-0.086772725,-0.007575937,0.028633444,-0.043382253,0.0238624,0.014833138,-0.051762428,-0.017511401,-0.11009286,0.0449541,0.026747903,-0.059628025,-0.039381914,0.00056528824,0.028731937,-0.022911457,0.047013287,0.02705204,-0.09602299,0.06346581,0.0770882,0.050129518,0.04685588,-0.05931414,-0.056198724,-0.03952426,-0.09363503,0.029512238,0.005609023,-0.042654254,0.09012691,-0.037423737,-0.018243195,0.047029093,0.06027875,0.03341434,-0.014511113,-0.011800326,0.008698693,-0.022157235,0.021734213,0.19719046,-0.001106702,-0.1146845,-0.03725848,-0.0575276,-0.04221918,-0.0059812437,-0.032640558,-0.019995753,0.011333053,0.024450114,0.034101155,-0.09102125,-0.083123066,0.042445116,0.039889205,0.012750167,0.0649673,0.075501144,0.04821372,-0.07624695,0.084699355,0.02627407,0.10127118,0.087851115,-0.021568023,-0.020882126,-1.3883633e-32,-0.03303378,0.020888038,-0.008089196,0.0055502295,-0.052063476,0.009977993,-0.044447448,0.041978586,-0.0801064,-0.14488705,-0.05006869,-0.11671634,0.10173677,-0.04750278,-0.088230595,0.0551318,-0.015015564,-0.038090736,-0.14754952,-0.007572351,-0.018518848,0.03999188,0.047109257,0.018298913,0.031450644,-0.09292768,0.052067447,0.011721525,-0.05447986,0.021052334,0.10943831,0.033149857,-0.09222298,-0.00659329,-0.021071164,-0.005688304,0.04911212,0.006412873,-0.0047532422,0.0401729,-0.023576397,0.064862154,-0.06059739,-0.09394235,-0.016924107,0.06017301,-0.035956834,-0.031920504,-0.015026291,-0.0279418,-0.008065408,-0.12166009,-0.041815624,-0.006935373,0.057709455,-0.071207196,-0.023408055,-0.04992212,-0.055470083,-0.025720071,0.0031255404,-0.017032495,-0.060085043,-0.07009533,0.040813528,0.0054032784,-0.0004829239,0.059847146,-0.008160697,0.041050997,0.039783206,0.013755385,-0.04051267,0.0019208177,-0.03819465,0.049969524,-0.012950999,-0.07683254,0.00472231,-0.022213724,-0.058036685,0.01249026,-0.035539616,-0.065409884,0.011447411,0.041004322,0.016454494,0.035305634,-0.02108128,0.085700415,0.0012846099,0.038715363,-0.041272398,-0.04198649,-0.05012139,-5.8929796e-08,0.034651972,-0.0067664557,-0.038933158,-0.028348729,0.028417027,-0.018715939,-0.025645511,0.022475392,0.020299578,0.06682666,0.027043747,-0.04072216,-0.072649814,0.0267747,-0.0002568699,0.09584877,0.08153575,0.030401494,-0.046901066,-0.07715036,0.05584857,-0.01705019,-0.029026937,0.018988153,0.004775351,-0.016759163,-0.015447954,0.003252285,0.019834863,0.00951179,-0.025537834,-0.04022249,-0.089666724,-0.06137833,0.0070790676,-0.03295852,0.029340317,-0.015495467,-0.03164774,-0.048095733,0.1381416,-0.0730013,-0.028925776,-0.018576354,-0.024455806,-0.08474797,0.052565776,0.008192824,-0.005395322,0.043415017,-0.053655904,-0.064118385,-0.01705411,-0.008408998,0.041331373,-0.01612184,0.031189403,-0.02114335,-0.021082016,-0.016311813,0.061219484,0.06357585,-0.05009769,-0.070626445,5

Pero, básicamente, como que toda esta conversación surgió a partir de, pues, primero pensar en que me voy y todos los cambios que estar acá llegaron a mi vida gracias a eso. ¿Qué acabo de decir? ¿Todos los cambios? Bueno, básicamente todos los cambios que llegaron a mi vida desde que estoy acá. Y eso lo resumí.

Y es divertido porque estaba hablando con una persona muy especial. hola Wendy, antes de venir a grabar el episodio y yo le decía, marica ahorita voy a, en un mes voy a volver a Colombia a mi antigua cotidianidad pero, como yo ya no soy la misma persona, ya no es mi cotidianidad y si bien es cierto, me voy a adaptar de nuevo mucho más rápido igual me voy a tener que adaptar de nuevo o sea, como que van a ser muchos cambios respecto a A como era antes. Eso está bien. Pero me parece particular. Y básicamente. Adaptarse. Es importante. Y justo cuando uno se adapta. Muchas veces. Es hora de irse. Como en mi caso. Que ya me voy para Colombia. Obviamente. Pienso volver a Brasil. No sé cuándo ni en qué condiciones. Pero pienso volver a este país. Me encantó.

ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),7,"raíz de todo esto, de estos cambios, de sentirse incómodo, etc., por tener una nueva cotidianidad, me puse a pensar en, o sea, como realmente qué son los cambios en la vida, ¿no? Y esta pregunta puede sonar boba, pero... Cuando yo antes me imaginaba o escuchaba a alguien hablar sobre cambio, me imaginaba básicamente irse a la mierda, o sea, dar un giro de 180 grados en la vida que literal sea como hoy vivo en Colombia, mañana voy para, no sé, Taiwán. No sé nada del lugar, no sé qué voy a ir a hacer, pero me voy para Taiwán. Digamos que es un ejemplo muy extremo, pero más o menos así yo me imaginaba el cambio. Cuando alguien decía, voy a cambiar mi vida, me lo imaginaba así.

Ese primer trabajo, que no sé si lo mencioné, pero tuve mi primer trabajo formal. Ese primer trabajo tuve que dejarlo. Perdí cálculo integral. Bueno, el evento sí fue un éxito. Mi podcast desde ese momento empezó a ser muchísimo más intermitente que ahorita estoy retomando. con episodios juiciosos, pero en ese momento empezó a irse al carajo, esa constancia. Y al fin y al cabo, tenía muchas cosas sobre mi plato que eran espectaculares, pero al final nada funcionó.",0.030277567,0.02834201,0.005191168,-0.08429117,-0.034474455,-0.00859695,0.11415911,0.03558653,0.053705703,0.009747546,0.021338928,-0.05294568,-0.03933284,0.041279078,0.06769171,0.012225823,0.00327347,0.03472202,-0.05354838,0.06279333,0.15208277,0.0018080563,-0.053411648,0.081766084,-0.06409581,-0.0035915961,0.008795497,0.022303632,-0.0974768,-0.07952407,-0.005786439,0.011303349,0.0718726,0.0010921224,0.068718426,0.009207079,-0.026099993,-0.07970974,-0.077871054,0.054778382,-0.026161408,0.0114943525,0.012632056,-0.027986323,0.0095904665,-0.12579419,0.061212618,0.008299178,0.04765588,0.024285702,-0.059793785,-0.0054309824,-0.06180291,0.009168334,0.008326805,0.010603069,0.022429947,0.013611818,0.035787314,-0.04046246,-0.014914611,-0.008720779,-0.043269455,0.03254096,0.00034825024,-0.011540951,0.06279686,0.00515343,-0.032114573,0.04252147,-0.0028456633,-0.009224572,-0.02644322,-0.007776925,-0.045350738,0.04686164,0.052448526,0.02024974,-0.03355974,-0.050431676,0.039269764,-0.0036199938,0.013804832,-0.1141685,0.067726396,0.04451075,-0.020003503,0.066803,0.011616376,-0.005247523,-0.04522358,0.036772225,-0.048974063,-0.048219223,0.032526292,0.038776215,0.010738975,-0.08043439,0.06497764,-0.011527697,0.09486634,0.052825876,0.0043182587,0.005936503,0.010774525,0.04486353,-0.025123421,0.013406173,-0.005191439,0.05985854,-0.05450825,-0.04152376,0.028201604,-0.052833825,-0.039272785,0.07404731,0.010992803,0.031953778,0.032862518,-0.015181244,-0.018106572,-0.00474849,-0.02996319,-0.012868863,0.02059632,-0.023502527,0.028981047,1.2542466e-32,0.0001287075,-0.08267323,0.0075918026,-0.0140626505,0.051617533,0.023363419,-0.03355801,0.016890673,-0.024976037,0.005513374,-0.07008853,0.1017252,0.001209802,-0.016936842,0.06300883,0.018060433,-0.032746647,0.04620158,-0.00079559366,0.00028625224,-0.024768038,0.04138547,-0.013877311,0.023409974,-0.013717665,0.13507956,0.031591047,-0.022923725,-0.049551383,0.06804565,-0.049618803,-0.028118031,0.02046313,-0.03813212,-0.003400564,-0.06967057,-0.0068721576,0.020075005,-0.009676916,-0.0697475,-0.06356135,0.009443221,-0.036377594,-0.0139734885,-0.01953125,-0.12579349,0.11596007,0.07591794,0.10468336,-0.015158023,0.0048048254,-0.088410094,0.062042445,-0.10418534,0.009882961,0.06390067,-0.06804957,0.07739448,-0.04725978,-0.012143585,-0.009570883,0.030914593,0.045557145,0.017243706,-0.069950156,-0.029059254,-0.03713266,-0.010879895,0.17226894,0.07467389,-0.048845015,0.010372304,-0.032311637,-0.031570736,0.028218728,0.0146597875,-0.010484934,-0.021019533,-0.008159669,0.059460342,-0.016643306,-0.052911784,0.032379568,0.056651328,0.11405393,0.09654362,0.06363081,0.04878068,-0.032287866,0.096263595,-0.036191363,0.073048465,0.10237117,-0.0015643758,0.02251773,-1.2455706e-32,0.019187357,0.046848774,0.011963157,-0.012182529,-0.05566506,0.010721805,0.027978333,-0.062874936,-0.07718481,-0.12124708,-0.060906813,-0.107238404,0.06364416,-0.061597,-0.08897013,0.042919617,-0.05877384,-0.07638916,-0.07719604,-0.02216686,-0.0120016495,0.025776558,0.05814099,0.020027408,-0.008702648,-0.13375163,-0.035269592,0.05532606,-0.0130915,-0.001309916,0.029547624,0.01587467,-0.0001292523,-0.026464975,-0.031190041,-0.018692963,0.04929746,-0.017399242,0.032539777,0.01781465,0.009224829,0.059863206,-0.026237126,-0.05784746,-0.00052977994,0.020081153,-0.008765082,-0.08969061,-0.023018835,-0.004440269,-0.013727827,-0.108610876,-0.04520309,-0.00940036,0.030478964,0.019813603,-0.031060444,-0.11987884,-0.08297076,0.01609766,0.014560861,-0.036301754,0.020630404,-0.04061891,0.100494415,0.028968884,0.012253014,-0.013695634,-0.036692597,0.056668945,0.14107737,0.0009110266,-0.15064724,0.028183833,0.014101742,-0.0049541467,-0.04470541,-0.0019384084,0.0023099307,0.022751532,-0.024798635,0.007023135,-0.010197262,-0.053486183,-0.02674336,0.04896655,0.011488117,0.06845948,-0.053899102,0.04887196,-0.03239812,0.043765027,-0.011389621,0.02270584,-0.030200666,-5.207108e-08,-0.024378434,0.013709266,-0.036296647,-0.04799034,-0.0069052926,-0.030554347,-0.031314317,0.005265103,0.048821878,-0.0014345439,0.07140812,-0.07181701,-0.05134435,0.07648661,-0.0012846632,0.026014155,0.117013454,0.017971136,-0.040206518,-0.12525772,0.08968506,-0.010396366,-0.023925172,0.01216031,0.027202893,0.019949619,-0.032158382,0.042122204,0.0029551415,0.010172092,-0.07479033,-0.08271842,-0.0491097,-0.049778238,-0.062402166,-0.03378483,0.079560794,-0.017120084,-0.021280482,0.0045075705,0.13511118,-0.00141809,-0.025220206,0.009896066,-0.0035516664,-0.07241389,0.06904264,0.00856936,-0.038897585,0.03751696,-0.017041687,-0.03053069,-0.020158606,-0.029207645,0.016133025,0.0133116,0.034916267,-0.035846487,-0.029903244,0.024964001,0.098543875,0.10258501,-0.0771389,-0.11500366,5
ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),13,"Y precisamente yo siento también que fue porque tenía demasiadas cosas en el plato. Entonces me llené antes de tiempo y como que quedó todo eso ahí pendiente. Este semestre es muy parecido. O siento que... Este semestre me recuerda mucho a 2023, solo que ahorita lo estoy abordando de una manera mucho más distinta. O sea, tengo el TEDx, que va a ser en un mes. Tengo el podcast y ahorita estoy retomándolo con fuerza. Estoy viendo cálculo vectorial, que es el nivel mucho más avanzado y maldita sea de cálculo integral. Además de eso estoy viendo ecuaciones diferenciales, que es el primo hermano que dan ganas como de pegarle también. Y este semestre han llegado ciertas oportunidades para tener trabajo, solo que por el mismo tema del tiempo realmente la vida no va para tanto.

ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),14,"mal. Pero... El cambio vino en abordarlo distinto. ¿Por qué? Porque en el 2023 yo me enfrenté a ese monstruo que se llama cálculo integral de... O sea, solo. No pedí ayuda de ningún tipo. Y pues al final eso no me ayudó en nada porque perdí la materia. Digamos que el TEDx salió muy bien también porque tenía bastante apoyo de mi universidad. Pero el resto de cosas salieron mal. Y bueno, como les decía, este semestre estoy teniendo clases particulares de cálculo vectorial, de ecuaciones diferenciales, porque realmente me di cuenta de que no puedo solo. Y que tengo que esforzarme el doble y necesito que alguien me explique como si fuera un niño de 5 años. Bueno, no, no como si fuera un niño de 5 años, pero realmente con más paciencia para que uno se dé cuenta de dónde están los vacíos de ese conocimiento.

ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),15,"básicamente estas materias son puras bases fundamentales, bien fundamentadas. Y bueno, ya el resto, digamos, que va solo, entre comillas. Entonces, estoy recibiendo apoyo de ese lado. El TEDx, digamos que en 2023 fue increíble hacerlo con mi universidad. Con esta universidad está siendo un poco más distinto, pero estoy teniendo la oportunidad de trabajar también con unos voluntarios increíblemente comprometidos, cosa que no me pasa en mi ciudad. Entonces, como que, bueno, son unas por otras. Y está siendo igual de emocionante el proceso. A pesar de que hay que hacer un montón de vainas, tengo un equipo en el cual confío y con el que sé que vamos a sacar el evento adelante y va a salir muy pro. Con el podcast también estoy recibiendo ayuda profesional. Gracias, Bianca. Un saludo si estás escuchando esto. Un abrazo, en serio.

ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),16,"Y creo que es eso. En este momento es eso. Lo que puede salir mal de las cosas que estoy haciendo. y cómo lo estoy abordando diferente, que básicamente es, oiga, pide ayuda de vez en cuando, si no es capaz solo pide ayuda, busque un equipo de gente igual de loca que usted, porque hay muchas cosas, yo también pensaba que para algunas cosas se necesitaba mucha plata, pero solamente hay que vender, por lo menos en el caso de los eventos y todo esto, hay que vender bien la idea, o sea, venderla bien vendida, con lo del TEDx. Igual, no quiero mentir acá, porque siento que en esta universidad la cultura del voluntariado está mucho más normalizada. Entonces, soy afortunado de hacer el evento acá. Pero bueno, esa es la diferencia entre mi 2023 y mi 2025. Espero no enloquecer cuando se termine el semestre.

ep111,El Mito de Taiwán (y el cambio de perspectiva),17,"queda un mes. Pero bueno. Eso es todo. Gracias por escuchar hasta el final este episodio. A la final hablé 18 minutos. Nada mal. Y nada. Dejen sus comentarios. Compartan el episodio si les hizo sentido algo de lo que dije. Y nos vemos en la próxima semana. Con un nuevo episodio de Inminente. Que va a salir uno el lunes.

ep112,Qué tal si...? El viaje de las posibilidades infinitas | Giovanni Stella,1,"﻿ Para mí la pregunta de qué tal si es como un viaje en un mundo de posibilidades infinitas. Ese segundo antes de uno empezar un proyecto nuevo y decir qué tal si hago X o qué tal si hago Y. Y lo que me parece realmente especial es que cuando uno se atreve, uno no sabe a dónde va a llegar realmente, pero sí sabe que se está moviendo. Porque a la final, cuando uno da el primer paso, el plan que uno tenía se va a la mierda. Pero acá hay una cosa y esa pregunta de qué tal si puede ser. ¿Un motor o un freno? Para una persona como yo, que es más atravesada que una mula sin frenos, es un motor increíble, es una ayuda magnífica. Pero para una persona tímida, que no se atrae y que lo piensa demasiado, es muy difícil.

ep112,Qué tal si...? El viaje de las posibilidades infinitas | Giovanni Stella,8,"de esos lugares que en mi cabeza... Me fascinaba mucho. Durante el MBA me hice amigo de muchos argentinos. Ahí fue donde empecé a obligarme a tratar de comunicar en español. Yo no había estudiado español, pero salía con ellos. Sabes, esas situaciones que se dan, que son incómodas, que tú sales con otros y todos hablan un idioma, pero tratan de hablar inglés para no hacerte sentir mal a ti. Y entonces yo dije, yo siempre había tenido en la cabeza el sueño de aprender a hablar español. Entonces dije, bueno, ustedes hablen español, yo trataré de entender.

Y bueno, la pregunta es, ¿cómo hace uno para pivotar y para responder a la incertidumbre? Giovanni tiene una forma muy interesante para manejar esa dificultad, esa angustia, esa culpa. Mi forma al final de enfrentar las dificultades siempre ha sido, de un cierto momento en adelante, siempre ha sido parcerizar la dificultad. Achiquitando lo haces en pedacitos más chiquitos en donde todo se vuelve un paso a la vez, un día a la vez. Es lo mismo cuando dejas de fumar. Yo fumé mucho tiempo.

ep112,Qué tal si...? El viaje de las posibilidades infinitas | Giovanni Stella,15,"te está gustando el episodio. Así que te voy a pedir un favor que te toma 5 segundos. Y es que califiques Inminente Podcast en la plataforma en la que te encuentres. Sea Spotify, sea Apple Podcast, sea YouTube. Porque eso nos ayuda muchísimo a seguir trayendo contenido de calidad e invitados geniales como Giovanni Estela. Así que, sin más que decir, continuemos con el episodio. Parcelizar la dificultad.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,1,"﻿ Hola y bienvenido a un nuevo episodio de Inminente Podcast. En esta semana tenemos una invitada muy especial. Porque normalmente cuando uno está joven y piensa en cómo se va a desarrollar su vida profesional, su vida personal, piensa de primerazo en la universidad. Pero esta persona, esta invitada, ¿qué mueve ese libreto? Dijo, venga. Para mí la universidad no es la mejor opción. Yo voy a coger por otro camino, que es el de entrar en contacto con el mundo real desde una etapa muy, muy temprana. Y eso le dio unos resultados, le ha dado unos resultados hasta el día de hoy increíbles.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,2,"muy, muy chéveres. Así que los dejo con el episodio de la semana junto a Aleja Henao. Quiero empezar con una pregunta y es ¿Quién es Aleja Henao? Bueno, ¿Quién es?

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,6,"mucho. Uno, me puse a investigar sobre lugares raros en el mundo. Encontré las Islas Canarias, entonces armé las diapositivas, fui a investigar y las hice. Y otro, porque siempre me fascinó el espacio, porque mis papás me pusieron en cuánto curso hubiera. Plastilina, dibujo, natación, patinaje, todo. Para que yo explorara a ver cuál. que es un privilegio, sin duda, para ver cuál pegaba, cuál me gustaba más. Entonces, en ese espacio hice una presentación. Hice la presentación porque literalmente senté a investigar, hice las diapositivas, pero se las hacía a mis papás y a mis muñecas. O sea, eso no era pues desde el inicio una cosa tan grande. Me fue gustando. Yo dije, ok, quiero trabajar en la NASA. Me dijeron que para eso había que ser geóloga. de una vaina científica, del geólogo, soñaba con eso. Luego me dijeron, no, hay que ser físico.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,7,"es físico, llega la NASA. Quiero ser físico. Entonces, cuando llegó décimo, en el colegio, en la escuela, bueno, si había alguna colombiana por ahí, la ponemos después. En décimo, me tocó hacer las prácticas del colegio y eran de contabilidad, no eran de tecnología ni nada de eso. Pero... Mi mamá me había llevado a un evento donde habíamos conocido una física que tenía una empresa de inteligencia artificial. Entonces nos acordamos de ella, hicimos todo, toda la... romper el esquema porque a mí me iban a mandar pues a hacer cobranza por teléfono. Dije, no, queremos mandarla para allá porque yo quería ver cómo eran los físicos y cómo yo iba a llegar a la NASA. Y me di cuenta de una vaina completamente distinta, que eran físicos detrás del computador poniendo eléctricas y numeritos, programando. Y no los que iban a la luna. Sí.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,11,"di cuenta en el camino, y para esa aleja que quería ser astronauta, lo que quería en realidad esa aleja chiquita era salvar el planeta.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,12,"loco! Y entonces, o sea, volviéndolo a conectar en la parte de la historia donde íbamos, empezaste a ir, eso, todavía estabas en el colegio, ¿no? Empezaste a ir cada ocho días y, o sea, ¿qué pasaba por tu cabeza? Porque, o sea, no sé, pero por lo menos en la cabeza del Juan Pablo más chiquito, Eso sería un sueño. De pronto no con startups en sí mismo, pero por ejemplo a mí me pasó con Naranja Media, que es una productora brutal de podcast.

Hoy todavía creo que es un juego.",0.0060378234,0.008246101,-0.037585124,-0.057844985,-0.050233126,-0.0582467,0.12424335,-0.0038433473,-0.017064812,0.013865463,0.045463953,-0.024219597,0.027711542,-0.0061373217,0.08827124,0.05666982,0.017634453,0.005192124,-0.024781074,-0.0065047913,0.13577451,-0.029245688,-0.0539761,0.057666395,-0.060657494,-0.016654149,-0.02111322,-0.003347064,-0.123946644,-0.10382286,-0.019071052,0.036431305,0.09973709,0.049488835,0.024634887,0.029941088,0.02807718,-0.095590934,-0.043890454,0.076467134,-0.032947272,-0.023604086,-0.056381922,0.00012195045,-0.05918916,-0.07548112,0.038900346,0.060373537,0.047927447,-0.010092667,-0.08647312,0.025896575,-0.07709455,-0.03836988,-0.020874374,0.005859159,0.060366217,0.00481639,0.06409975,-0.014143342,-0.12152862,-0.004643402,-0.0014404627,0.01969481,0.05158662,-0.03558151,0.02965015,-0.016070917,-0.05791793,0.07444984,0.046057515,-0.021690434,-0.043472454,0.032871325,-0.08143513,0.06661678,0.062351298,-0.0013361465,-0.028051376,-0.055623993,0.0012330675,0.012016064,-0.016038505,-0.06389363,0.03460394,-0.024924643,-0.063715175,0.08083368,0.03790312,-0.025955006,0.02052223,0.010464975,-0.042098925,0.004310868,0.006214423,0.038547285,0.02770826,-0.03803202,0.007632794,-0.015859528,0.09860134,0.019749863,0.0912056,-0.04476896,-0.026864095,0.03391304,0.022819547,-0.0057587647,0.0635864,0.039661217,-0.08573884,-0.028609853,-0.020353494,0.028942369,-0.033127777,-0.007307423,0.0026167075,0.01069541,0.0017848113,-0.052085146,0.0115164425,0.030472584,-0.02882357,-0.029068109,0.0038787425,-0.030761851,0.021943256,1.6983497000000002e-32,0.002737197,-0.02951049,0.024472006,-0.008145547,0.01908675,0.039162662,-0.030898489,0.05896479,-0.049455747,0.050140917,-0.12685153,0.07760057,-0.011952606,0.050791666,0.10181216,0.0005125345,-0.026397832,-0.00380158,0.0011304555,0.03140182,0.00914121,0.023966512,0.016702862,-0.01619201,-0.016274823,0.017917156,-0.016256548,-0.037589207,0.037738867,0.044377293,-0.047098193,-0.03821565,0.06512234,-0.030448707,-0.038575143,-0.0830583,-0.0050642453,0.023927415,-0.03995666,-0.038508058,-0.06584483,0.043149203,0.0109494245,0.0383392,-0.03529916,-0.068536095,0.055589527,0.035996474,-0.0015644248,-0.011809948,-0.046963926,-0.060388077,0.07113478,-0.09086021,0.017159656,-0.0066327583,0.017534258,0.07740765,-0.02128228,-0.0644285,0.042714484,-0.025499191,0.08257335,-0.007270473,0.021348022,-0.017574882,0.00248974,0.045399647,0.13639796,0.075535305,-0.07716898,0.022952054,-0.054930314,-0.000962422,0.03691101,0.023704715,0.037960574,-0.07690173,-0.039572157,-0.0059186453,-0.014379863,-0.046079755,0.0129440585,0.05801867,0.0828396,0.07823967,0.07796434,0.03449216,-0.0018413141,0.10342686,-0.02975709,0.041723423,0.031752333,-0.059026565,0.033677403,-1.4908905000000002e-32,-0.055444464,0.09007542,-0.022797674,0.040309723,-0.03453402,-0.01966195,0.06976319,0.021530602,-0.075759746,-0.15772864,-0.035503738,-0.10119277,0.084270924,-0.036388464,-0.048287276,0.048372254,-0.07460338,-0.0078994725,-0.04296313,-0.06304336,-0.046982136,0.0097771,0.00632644,-0.020161156,-0.027683908,-0.06546286,-0.07138495,-0.017961038,-0.038761687,0.040889565,0.014104044,0.060938068,0.049504556,0.05144597,-0.007996898,0.00066058245,0.036647864,-0.033031825,0.05377445,0.055074103,0.017010788,0.08048001,-0.017710883,-0.033984084,-0.027856372,0.03797308,-0.012990081,-0.11016706,-0.026743477,0.036756165,0.07622686,-0.033534676,-0.072666004,-0.057663538,0.014532651,-0.06256032,0.008112418,-0.12913921,-0.06323805,-0.03516027,-0.03226081,-0.00095838297,-0.010561374,-0.075139605,0.079503365,0.025695225,-0.0032097998,0.090394795,-0.0013557499,0.004331004,0.09040677,0.021524107,-0.12362803,0.0050102198,-0.011160121,-0.0017296461,-0.08265505,-0.008945397,-0.028977875,-0.01445287,0.016815994,-0.00562997,-0.007062913,-0.0639193,-0.022282341,0.032542817,-0.00012576692,0.11067664,-0.010788329,0.07914555,0.0028223388,0.027817635,-0.029016579,0.07414274,-0.020097872,-5.7262987e-08,-0.07473116,-0.01926656,-0.004295942,-0.0028285685,0.042198766,0.033291142,0.015076079,0.020030428,0.08911819,-0.043828875,0.03185952,-0.04185505,-0.06259921,0.0044691996,0.029525442,0.088504836,0.11080494,0.0343099,-0.008501286,-0.07678961,0.1507171,0.029299255,-0.08645203,0.085351236,-0.0012585968,-0.0014496553,-0.0978754,0.034950748,-0.018634044,0.027431112,-0.03442835,-0.09074712,-0.0425079,-0.049221985,-0.019446412,-0.020950977,0.021526946,-0.03430398,0.022335077,0.0017854074,0.10970515,-0.003065474,-0.094918445,-0.018123493,-0.03434437,-0.07275903,0.0070600687,0.0019801948,-0.012389683,0.05192923,-0.06467187,-0.033619545,0.07420605,-0.03731709,0.05322004,-0.04773887,0.012461584,-0.002394458,-0.026870724,0.017348643,0.09098589,0.09537836,0.029978761,-0.08835576,6

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,17,"yo decía, vea, primero lo volátiles que somos, ¿no? Entonces, por cosas de la vida, por los cursos, por mis papás, por un montón de factores, dije, lo mío es ir a la NASA, ¿sí? Entonces, ¿qué tengo que hacer? Empecé a preguntarle, oiga. Pues al lado mío no había nadie que trabajara allá, entonces me tocaba, ¿usted qué sabe de esa gente? Entonces, ¿qué geología? ¿Qué ser científica? ¿Qué ser física? Hasta que no me senté literal con un físico. Me dijo, bueno, sí, pues es uno de los caminos, pero se va a demorar un montón y bla, bla, bla. Miré y este otro.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,18,"Y no pasa así también. Fue darme cuenta de eso. Yo les preguntaba, bueno, ¿y dónde estudiaron física? ¿Y por qué lo hicieron? Blah, blah, blah. Dijeron, no, lo que hacemos hoy, más allá de ser físicos, lo aprendimos en cursos. Yo, ¿cómo? ¿Y los contrataron por saber cursos? Sí. Y yo ahí, ahí se me volvió a romper el cerebro. Yo dije, ¿cómo así? O sea, hay gente que...

Yo no, de entrada uno no dice, oiga, vamos a entrar a una industria donde vayan a haber muchas barreras para mí, ¿no? Para lo que soy, para lo que tengo hoy.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,32,"tan junior, ¿sabes? Y yo, no, pues, total. Pero de pronto de QA, ¿te gustaría? Y yo, ni idea que era QA. Y yo, sí, sí, de una. Luego supe que era hacer pruebas al software. Menos mal, no sé en dónde estaría. No sé por qué dije que sí. Pasaron unas semanas y me volvió a llamar y me dijo, ¿vas a tener un encuentro con tu próxima jefa? Me senté con ella y más allá en una entrevista yo le pregunté, ¿y qué es un project manager? Y cuando te levantas, ¿qué haces? O sea, la entrevisté yo a ella. Dije, mira, ¿cómo te tratas cuando salgamos de acá? Yo ya sé qué quiero hacer por el resto de mi vida. Quiero dedicarme a hacer esto. Gracias.

Y yo, a mí, allá. ¿En serio? Sí. Y yo, bueno, yo estaba muy feliz en la empresa, era muy feliz en Project Manager, pero también era mi sueño y todo el mundo lo sabía, además, cuando les conté, fue como, my God, obvio, o sea.

Si yo me paro y digo, bueno, hoy voy a ayudar a tantos, hoy voy a inspirar a tantos, pues no hay que así meter la pata en la mitad, es parte del camino, o sea, no es esta métrica, es la otra.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,58,"la manda Natalia, y es... ¿Qué cosas nunca cambiarías de ti? Porque hacen parte de tu esencia. ¿Qué cosas nunca cambiarías sobre mí? La curiosidad. Y la curiosidad atada con la capacidad de asombro. Como siempre estoy buscando nuevas formas de aprender, de hacer las cosas, de encontrar una nueva forma. Pero como lo que me sigue pasando, digo, ¿en serio? Yo, wow, y lo celebro y tomo un espacio y digo, lo hice muy bien. Porque si no, hacemos, hacemos y hacemos. Cuando llegamos a la cima o al lugar que queremos llegar, bueno, sí, llegué, cinco minutos. ¿Y qué? ¿Sí? Entonces, ¿qué pasa si en cada escaloncito que voy subiendo voy celebrando? O sea, yo, cada cosa, ¿qué me pasa? Cada llamada, cada podcast, cada vaina.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,59,"hicimos un podcast y nos llevamos una hora, dos horas, tres horas hablando. Entonces, como no pierdo esa capacidad de asombro en el camino y uno de los retos era si ha pasado, buscar encajar. Yo tengo que vestirme más profesional, irme en tacones, o sea, una vaina para parecer de esta otra forma. Y al contrario, entre más soy y parezco, o sea, me visto de colores, me gusta la NASA, soy quien soy, de la forma auténtica, y hablo y digo marica, y digo, ¿sí? Y no pretendo ser otra persona, ¡ush! Ahí está la magia. O sea, y al contrario, la gente me dice, es que es por ser tú, es que eres muy particular, o sea, como que, o sea, hablas de cosas técnicas, pero igual la presentación está llena de brillitos, y de colores, y de muñequitos, si estás hablando de una vaina, sí.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,61,"startup, estoy emprendiendo. Es un tema que me pesa decirlo. Estoy emprendiendo, estoy dando conferencias, estoy compartiendo conocimiento, estoy cumpliéndole a esa niña de chiquita. Nos llevamos a la NASA algún día, si saben de la NASA. Ahí estamos.

ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,63,"este espacio, por esta conversación tan emocionante. Y segundo, aquí ando, para el que nos escuche, que necesite seguir hablando, chismoseando, estamos ahí para ayudarles en lo que necesiten. ¿Cómo pueden encontrarte las personas en redes sociales? Aleja en AOE, en todas, la mayoría, o Aleja en Auspitia, ahí me encuentran en LinkedIn, en Instagram, pronto en YouTube. Eso. Ahí estamos. Bueno, Aleja, de nuevo, muchísimas gracias por el tiempo, por la buena conversación. Antes de terminar, voy a tirar un dato random. Hay cosas, justamente yo estaba teniendo esta conversación hoy después de almorzar. Y es sobre las cosas que aparentemente uno aprende y no tienen una utilidad en lo que uno hace, ¿cierto? Y uno pensaría que la gente que se dedica a tecnología, a startups, no les va a servir de absolutamente nada meterse un curso de salsa o merengue o lo que sea que les enseñe",0.016314836,-0.052595478,-0.021729715,-0.059419654,-0.02539881,-0.015314579,0.09057264,-0.06933732,0.02822341,0.009866554,0.09860685,-0.037451547,-0.009236436,-0.019790888,0.09454772,0.055411357,-0.014418319,0.011795972,-0.030262655,0.030703273,0.088209204,-0.021867838,-0.05302102,0.0845384,-0.025875174,-0.038289424,0.015359589,0.029559486,-0.07563647,-0.0337903,-0.05671142,-0.0004689504,0.11140685,0.032995503,-0.048983693,0.004035066,-0.012581548,-0.1108253,-0.0641318,0.08507735,-0.07860036,0.032600902,-0.018016424,-0.0010292187,-0.03598875,-0.07221359,0.013721978,0.052815393,0.0629071,0.0035426568,-0.070796795,0.007435818,-0.07447324,-0.002131,0.024656666,-0.012853621,-0.043945983,0.027556911,0.044626463,0.02350644,0.049862277,-0.047635917,0.0064110816,0.058843203,0.037039682,0.0007808293,0.016118936,0.062328015,-0.05303115,0.073773764,0.033462968,-0.010425481,-0.03666474,0.066745214,-0.03361216,0.07168294,-0.0086708395,-0.03448524,-0.07332857,-0.023264334,0.0137283,0.0050143823,0.022573696,-0.061552104,0.01996565,-0.006139554,-0.0059709237,0.024306018,-0.013652831,0.0052734246,-0.045387324,0.106588565,-0.014406491,-0.04390066,0.08094989,0.01056994,0.03566674,-0.06676488,-0.022684703,-0.005333624,0.11377464,0.05816753,0.053420916,-0.020766802,0.023950618,0.04337785,-0.038381234,-0.024123816,0.06857961,0.08109796,-0.031746827,-0.07123197,-0.045659963,-0.051074345,-0.057157747,-0.054633602,0.00036883124,-0.052838795,0.011443368,-0.0053019817,0.021270964,-0.02753969,-0.007568394,-0.064534046,0.02609674,-0.05897867,-0.01705177,1.3586566e-32,0.07531404,-0.0020573598,-0.011069276,0.060631033,0.033704154,0.090744175,-0.052708946,0.025153065,-0.07532624,-0.005364408,-0.07991504,0.08655055,-0.0089889625,0.040738564,0.15211375,-0.00589697,0.0018476641,-0.01255703,0.0313193,0.092527404,0.0046091257,0.04991971,-0.03558438,-0.04107466,-0.03604542,0.027216852,0.036897585,-0.07455527,-0.0331176,0.038046908,-0.059687756,0.022758458,0.036683556,-0.010431733,-0.0035624108,-0.09774753,0.045061268,0.026664795,-0.04702312,-0.075084664,-0.008074,0.06770695,-0.033892825,0.05861767,-0.0030499736,-0.036716744,0.10949946,-0.008699358,0.029557277,0.010077165,-0.046919525,-0.05563469,0.02263177,-0.055614747,-0.030815441,0.01744487,-0.07694093,0.078288406,-0.053376794,-0.078552514,-0.0030618464,-0.0095881,0.077161424,0.017280761,-0.005951381,0.019450203,0.0015826412,-0.0035138014,0.18144806,0.036453273,-0.001077337,-0.020891635,-0.08380284,0.021762032,0.016505374,0.03893071,0.018744146,-0.021092376,-0.014811863,0.016503828,-0.027763372,-0.028025057,0.078525886,0.0577723,0.028548684,0.08486946,0.100843966,0.048037756,-0.021709042,0.13051319,0.01599798,0.10840491,0.06922456,-0.06057229,0.01817521,-1.3061592e-32,0.0240346,-0.0025298041,0.0016462113,-0.034566686,-0.013358,-0.0075856033,-0.011707119,0.037179124,-0.0042244364,-0.12506747,-0.0090606725,-0.12788807,0.07933366,-0.0049573537,-0.01183155,0.040903017,-0.016200744,-0.054003567,-0.076596275,-0.059586648,-0.0063454765,-0.027774796,0.023175625,-0.025631549,0.0090774875,-0.08403407,-0.027379923,-0.023850618,-0.07652766,-0.026559388,0.04016953,-0.017165123,-0.010323369,0.0052910103,-0.0028139022,0.07644637,0.06778196,-0.012315958,-0.029273722,0.016962456,0.044273756,0.048388164,-0.021678464,-0.076219276,-0.0025361048,0.021216715,-0.05467105,-0.12252506,-0.114321776,-0.010221577,0.06904374,-0.110244945,-0.06322375,-0.041176997,-0.013689822,-0.071354926,-0.01743999,-0.04126892,-0.10572112,0.047731053,0.027799672,0.0056499634,-0.09271242,-0.038034666,0.059884045,-0.0012191946,-0.0034332778,0.023363406,-0.050285228,-0.0020736966,0.084399156,-0.043047838,-0.120534375,0.016227692,0.019577721,-0.051791903,-0.028644959,-0.045280512,-0.005754387,-0.014325978,-0.0427503,-0.006023327,-0.046513215,-0.020925056,0.044947173,0.0021465744,0.022706812,0.10720556,-0.056813065,0.08556022,0.024585817,0.0062559457,-0.04742957,-0.012728908,-0.064668916,-5.662138e-08,0.026798282,0.025194358,-0.00019262632,-0.039224897,0.04168344,0.059604757,0.029904326,0.016901026,0.082687646,-0.007889286,0.036503404,-0.02785133,-0.0834364,0.052311406,0.0026415917,0.014249863,0.038662825,0.023314793,0.011119553,-0.03488016,0.057360772,0.00049271825,-0.093898736,0.026004674,-0.010471022,0.023740849,-0.035966337,0.009188985,-0.011070735,0.053832576,-0.06718588,-0.05741471,-0.025536994,-0.055588696,-0.045546778,-0.05054137,0.032700792,-0.038609426,0.0037999179,-0.053420603,0.14379075,-0.0038234664,-0.021471854,-0.024722578,-0.020622686,-0.041678865,0.049811937,0.0051429016,0.008911005,-0.028317079,-0.040798046,-0.057140607,0.04594538,-0.0049065445,0.011496209,-0.09241302,0.063382514,0.064935945,0.031497248,-0.01841245,0.1112065,0.09018868,-0.052116405,-0.04555356,6
ep110,De soñar con la NASA a romper el libreto | Aleja Henao,64,"a bailar. Hombre, eso ayuda muchísimo. Yo hice un curso, un solo curso de salsa. Y les digo una cosa, en todo evento, tech, congreso, lo que ustedes quieran, que se respete. hay fiesta, hay after. Así que ahí es donde se hace el verdadero networking. En el evento no. Las conversaciones profundas, los amigos de verdad, se hacen en el after del evento. Perfecto. Sí, y tengan pues obviamente listo su pitch, su conversación, qué le van a decir, cómo quieren hacer. Así nos conocimos Juanpa y yo. No crean pues que parece que fuera toda la vida, pero nos hemos visto una vez. y de resto nos chismoseamos por redes.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),1,"﻿ Desde hace mucho tiempo yo me he debatido de una pregunta que digo, parce, ¿esto realmente es un proyecto viable o no? Y no me refiero al podcast, no me refiero a los TEDx, no me refiero a absolutamente nada de lo que hago en mi vida profesional. Me refiero a las relaciones de pareja. ¿Vale la pena teniendo 20 años conseguirse una novia o hay que esperar hasta los 30? Antes de grabar este episodio, yo tenía una postura muy rígida respecto al tema, pero después de una conversación muy larga donde ustedes van a poder escuchar las mejores partes, ahorita yo digo... Venga, no se ve tan mal. Así que, nada, el episodio está buenísimo. Invita a cuestionarse muchas cosas y a ver otras de forma distinta. Así que, bienvenidos a un nuevo episodio de Inminente Podcast. Claro, entonces estaba tratando de seguirte la idea.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),3,"Tú eres un chocolate todavía. Entonces, no he tenido que pasar por situaciones como realmente difíciles, ¿cierto? Pues, si lo vemos con respecto a otras historias de Latinoamérica en especial, ¿cierto?

O si yo quiero tener el TEDx más grande del mundo, también puedo hacerlo. Sin riesgo alguno.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),4,"obviamente, el evento, los proyectos, todo tiene un riesgo, pero si fallo, lo peor que puede pasar es nada. Aprender. Porque, o sea, no va a tener una implicación en mi bienestar, en donde duermo, en si voy a comer o no voy a comer. ¿Sí me explico? Sí, sí, sí. Como que no toca ese nivel de vida de supervivencia. Ok. Y tú estás diciendo entonces... Vamos por acá que hay mucho barro. Tú estás diciendo entonces que si decides no dedicarle tiempo al amor... Es más seguro que puedas tener una vida como la que estás planeando. Eso es lo que entiendo. Nada son certezas. O sea, es difícil predecir qué va a pasar en los próximos 5 o 10 años de mi vida. Yo solo tengo una cosa segura y es que voy a seguir experimentando.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),6,"pensando en eso y yo siento que Brasil ha sido el experimento más violento que yo he hecho en toda mi vida. ¿Y por qué? Porque ha sido como un momento de un crecimiento exponencial y de aprendizaje en muchas áreas que en mis condiciones normales me hubiese tomado muchísimo más tiempo.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),12,"con ella. Pedro y Joaquín estaban enamorados y Pedro era un desgraciado. Pedro agarraba y le quitó todo el dinero a Joaquín, se lo robó porque Pedro era muy pobre. Y en la otra obra... Yo tenía que enamorarme de Edda Gabler, que Edda Gabler, así se llama la obra, quema la novela, el manuscrito de un amante suyo, ex amante, y le destroza la vida y el tipo vuelve al alcoholismo, así el drama total. Y cuando nosotros hablamos de realismo, se trata de justamente abarcar la obra desde lo más, la esencia pura. Entender el personaje, saber por qué hizo esto, por qué hizo el otro, bla, bla, bla. Y yo detestaba tanto a Eda Gabler y también a Pedro, porque yo dije, es que qué pedo, ¿no? O sea, agarró y le partió la madre y lo golpeó, pero lo amaba.

ep109,El amor es una distracción (Y quizás está bien),14,"el dramaturgo o la obra no te da todo el eje esquemático psicológico de lo que le pasa al personaje, entonces en escena tú vas desarrollando y tú te vas dando cuenta de que probablemente en el caso de Edda Gabler, Edda Gabler a pesar de que lo tenía todo, porque lo tenía todo, tenía una grande mansión, tenía los caballos, tenía dos esposos, tenía un amante, no era feliz. Ella tenía una depresión muy fuerte y no lo sabía. ¿Por qué? Porque eran los 1910.
